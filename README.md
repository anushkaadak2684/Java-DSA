# Java DSA 🚀

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) programs in Java** that helped me **build and clear my fundamental DSA logic**.

All the programs here are the ones I **practiced while learning DSA concepts**, *before* jumping into **LeetCode problem solving**.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository includes:
- Java implementations of core DSA concepts
- Practice problems that helped me understand **how and why** algorithms work
- Programs solved while learning concepts step by step
- Problems that are **not from LeetCode**, but played an important role in strengthening my understanding

This repo represents my **learning phase of DSA**, not just final or optimized solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals**
- Improve **logical thinking for problem solving**
- Build confidence **before solving LeetCode problems**
- Maintain a personal reference of learned concepts
